## Overview
This app will allow you to create an Account. Once an account has been made, and you are logged in it will show you your most recently uploaded lists. Each lists will have a title that is the state/season you are camping. Beneath the title is going to be a list that is clicked/tapped on the expand. You can also click edit your lists from the collapsed menu. Once expanded you can click/tap on individual items to "check-off" items. Once all items are checked off the list will show "completed" so you know that you have everything. The list can than be "reset". Other users lists can be made public or private. Public lists will show up in feeds as the title and can be saved/favorited for other users to use or build upon their own lists.
